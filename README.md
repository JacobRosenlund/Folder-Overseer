# Folder-Overseer
*Manages all the files in selected folders.*

This projects goals are to provide a way to manage all the contents of a directory by:
- Passivly monitoring the contents of said directory
- Assign different files, directories, etc to certain "manager" directories
- Moving each of the newly added files into designated directories (preferably inside the same directory)

Potential routes:
- User-defined directories
- Pre-defined folder layouts

# Why
In essence, I am tired of constantly having my downloads folder get cluttered, and I thought this would be a fun problem to solve.
